Used this Repository for my Research Project for the Govt. of India for comparing the bullet images if they are fired from the same firearm or not. This in turn, would be able to link the FIRs filed at different police stations to let them figure out the matching criminal cases. 

# x3prplus - Analying Bullet Striations From .x3p Files

The steps of the algorithm and a front-end to the x3prplus R package have been created as a Shiny Web Application. The application can be accessed at https://erichare.shinyapps.io/x3prplus

One can still follow the instructions at the bottom to reproduce the study, but for a comparison of two bullet lands, the web application is a simpler approach.

## Introduction

This repository contains the R package `x3prplus`, along with supporting resources for manipulating bullet images to determine whether two bullets are a match (fired from the same gun barrel) The **repository branches** are organized as follows:

- **master** Contains the R package `x3prplus`
- **application** Contains a companion Shiny application to assess the probability that two bullets are a match
- **application++** Contains a companion Shiny application which walks through each algorithm stage
- **papers** Contains academic papers involving this package
- **presentations** Contains presentations involving this package

## Installation

The `x3prplus` package can be installed using `devtools`:

  `devtools::install_github("heike/x3prplus")`
  
## The Hamby Study

The Hamby study bullets can be assessed using this package, as detailed in Hare, Hofmann, Carriquiry (2016) (See `papers/jcgs-2016`). To do so, follow these steps:

1. In an R session, install `x3pr` (Petraco 2015) with `install_github("npetraco/x3pr")` (See http://www.github.com/npetraco/x3pr for more information)
2. Install `x3prplus` with `devtools::install_github("heike/x3prplus")`
3. Install more supporting packages with `install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "zoo"))`
4. Download the Hamby study images from the [NIST Database](https://tsapps.nist.gov/NRBTD)
    - Browse to https://tsapps.nist.gov/NRBTD
    - Click "Search and Download"
    - Leaving everything default, click Search at the bottom right.
    - Scroll down to the table, and click the "# of Bullets" column **twice** to sort in descending order. The two Hamby datasets will be the first two options.
    - Check the box next to each, and choose Download Files
5. Unzip the folders of images to a directory of your choosing. For instance, a path such as `~/Desktop/Hamby252_3DX3P1of2` should contain all the images of the form "Br1 Bullet 1-1.x3p", and a path such as `~/Desktop/Hamby252_3DX3P2of2` should contain all the images of the form "Ukn Bullet B-1.x3p"
6. Create a folder `csvs` in the same location that contains the Hamby folders
7. Execute the code stored in `papers/jcgs-2016/code/checkBullets.R` Make sure to set the variables `knowndatadir` and `unknowndatadir` to the two directories from step 5.
8. Execute the code stored in `papers/jcgs-2016/code/complete_hamby.R`. Again, make sure to set the variables `knowndatadir` and `unknowndatadir` to the two directories from step 5.
9. Execute the code stored in `papers/jcgs-2016/code/evaluation_hamby.R`. 
10. The complete results will be stored in the csvs folder, in the file name `bullet-stats.csv`
